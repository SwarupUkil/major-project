# Proposal
I will be creating a game that is inspired by the game Furi. It will be a 
2-D action shoot em' up. The user will control the main player character and 
be able to the fight against the boss character over multiple phases.

## Needs To Have
**Player**
- The player can walk in any direction
- Can shoot bullets on left click
- Able to shoot a precision bullet on a hold right click
- Ability to dash

**Boss**
- The boss can produce attacks
- The boss has at least 4 unique attacks

**Game**
- At least 3 functioning fight phase (one of which is a bullet hell)
- Different map layouts for each phase
- Win, Lose, and Title Screen
- Functioning health bars for the boss and user
- The player and user can be damaged
- There is a collision detection/in-general-detection for deleting objects
- Have a testing room, where the player can test out the game mechanics 
  with a dummy boss
- Have a easy mode and normal mode


## Nice To Have
- Sprites for characters, attacks, the game map 
- Animations for transitions
- The boss has an AI that can respond to the players attacks 
- Another Boss
- Some tid-bits of story that hints at what the game is about
